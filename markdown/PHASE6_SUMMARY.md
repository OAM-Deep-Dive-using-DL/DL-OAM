   - Created visualization tools for comparing different scale effects

## Configuration

Added configuration parameters in `config/simulation_params.yaml`:

```yaml
advanced_physics:
  use_fft_phase_screen: true
  phase_screen_resolution: 256
  phase_screen_size: 2.0
  kolmogorov_spectrum: true
  spectral_index: 3.6667  # 11/3 for Kolmogorov
  inner_scale: 0.001
  outer_scale: 100.0
  turbulence_layers: 3
```

## Testing and Validation

Created `test_advanced_physics.py` script with comprehensive tests:

1. **FFT Phase Screen Test**: Verifies the generation of phase screens with proper statistics
2. **Non-Kolmogorov Test**: Validates the power spectrum for different spectral indices
3. **Multi-layer Test**: Confirms the correct implementation of the Hufnagel-Valley profile and layer combination
4. **Aperture Averaging Test**: Validates the aperture averaging factor calculation
5. **Inner/Outer Scale Test**: Confirms the correct modification of the power spectrum
6. **Full Channel Test**: Tests the end-to-end simulation with all advanced physics features

## Performance Impact

The advanced physics features provide more realistic simulation of atmospheric effects, particularly:

1. **More Accurate Turbulence**: The FFT-based phase screens and non-Kolmogorov support provide more realistic turbulence effects
2. **Altitude-Dependent Effects**: The multi-layer modeling captures the variation of turbulence with altitude
3. **Realistic Scintillation**: The enhanced aperture averaging provides more accurate modeling of scintillation effects
4. **Scale-Dependent Effects**: The inner/outer scale effects capture the realistic behavior of turbulence at different scales

## Documentation
