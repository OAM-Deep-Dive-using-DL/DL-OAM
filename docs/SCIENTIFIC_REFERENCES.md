## Core OAM Beam Physics

### Laguerre-Gaussian Beam Model

Our implementation of Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams follows the mathematical formulation established in:

**Allen, L., Beijersbergen, M.W., Spreeuw, R.J.C., and Woerdman, J.P. (1992).** "Orbital angular momentum of light and the transformation of Laguerre-Gaussian laser modes." *Physical Review A*, 45(11), 8185-8189.

The normalized electric field of an LG beam is given by:

$$E_{lp}(r, \phi, z) = C \frac{w_0}{w(z)} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}r}{w(z)} \right)^{|l|} L_p^{|l|}\left(\frac{2r^2}{w^2(z)}\right) \exp\left(-\frac{r^2}{w^2(z)}\right) \exp(il\phi) \exp\left(i(2p+|l|+1)\arctan\frac{z}{z_R}\right) \exp\left(-ikz-ik\frac{r^2}{2R(z)}\right)$$

where:
- $C = \sqrt{\frac{2p!}{\pi(p+|l|)!}}$ is the normalization factor
- $w(z) = w_0 \sqrt{1 + (z/z_R)^2}$ is the beam width at distance $z$
- $z_R = \pi w_0^2 / \lambda$ is the Rayleigh range
- $R(z) = z(1 + (z_R/z)^2)$ is the radius of curvature
- $L_p^{|l|}$ is the generalized Laguerre polynomial
- $l$ is the azimuthal index (topological charge)
- $p$ is the radial index

Our implementation has been validated against Figure 2 in Allen et al. (1992), which shows the intensity profiles for different combinations of $l$ and $p$.

### Beam Width Evolution

The evolution of the beam width with propagation distance follows the standard Gaussian beam propagation formula:

$$w(z) = w_0 \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{z}{z_R}\right)^2}$$

This has been validated against:

**Yao, A.M., and Padgett, M.J. (2011).** "Orbital angular momentum: origins, behavior and applications." *Advances in Optics and Photonics*, 3(2), 161-204.

## Atmospheric Turbulence Effects

### Turbulence Model

Our atmospheric turbulence model is based on the Kolmogorov spectrum with von Karman modifications for inner and outer scales:

$$\Phi_n(\kappa) = 0.033 C_n^2 (\kappa^2 + \kappa_0^2)^{-11/6} \exp(-\kappa^2/\kappa_m^2)$$

where:
- $C_n^2$ is the refractive index structure parameter (turbulence strength)
- $\kappa_0 = 2\pi/L_0$ is the outer scale wavenumber
- $\kappa_m = 5.92/l_0$ is the inner scale wavenumber
- $L_0$ is the outer scale of turbulence (typically 10-100 m)
- $l_0$ is the inner scale of turbulence (typically 1-10 mm)

This follows the models described in:

**Andrews, L.C., and Phillips, R.L. (2005).** "Laser beam propagation through random media." *SPIE Press*, 2nd edition.

### Phase Structure Function

The phase structure function used in our simulator follows:

$$D_\phi(r) = 6.88 \left(\frac{r}{r_0}\right)^{5/3}$$

for $l_0 < r < L_0$, where $r_0$ is the Fried parameter:

$$r_0 = (0.423 k^2 C_n^2 L)^{-3/5}$$

This is based on:

**Fried, D.L. (1966).** "Optical resolution through a randomly inhomogeneous medium for very long and very short exposures." *Journal of the Optical Society of America*, 56(10), 1372-1379.

### OAM Mode Crosstalk

The crosstalk between OAM modes due to atmospheric turbulence is modeled following:

**Paterson, C. (2005).** "Atmospheric turbulence and orbital angular momentum of single photons for optical communication." *Physical Review Letters*, 94(15), 153901.

The key relationship is that the crosstalk between adjacent OAM modes ($\Delta l = 1$) scales as:

$$\text{Crosstalk} \propto \left(\frac{r_0}{w(z)}\right)^{-5/3}$$

for weak turbulence, and saturates for strong turbulence.

### Scintillation

The scintillation index (intensity fluctuation) is modeled as:

$$\sigma_I^2 = 1.23 C_n^2 k^{7/6} L^{11/6}$$

for weak turbulence, with saturation for strong turbulence following:

$$\sigma_I^2 = 1 + \exp(-\sigma_I^2) \text{ for } \sigma_I^2 > 1$$

This follows:

**Rytov, S.M., Kravtsov, Y.A., and Tatarskii, V.I. (1989).** "Principles of statistical radiophysics. 4. Wave propagation through random media." *Springer*.

## Path Loss and Atmospheric Absorption

### Free-Space Path Loss

The free-space path loss is calculated using the standard Friis transmission formula:

$$L_{\text{FS}} = \left(\frac{4\pi d}{\lambda}\right)^2$$

where $d$ is the distance and $\lambda$ is the wavelength.

### Atmospheric Absorption

For millimeter-wave frequencies, we model atmospheric absorption based on:

**ITU-R P.676-12 (2019).** "Attenuation by atmospheric gases and related effects."

The specific attenuation due to atmospheric gases is calculated as:

$$\gamma = \gamma_o + \gamma_w \text{ [dB/km]}$$

where $\gamma_o$ is the dry air attenuation and $\gamma_w$ is the water vapor attenuation, both of which are frequency-dependent.

## Fading and Channel Models

### Rician Fading

For small-scale fading, we use the Rician fading model:

$$h = \sqrt{\frac{K}{K+1}} + \sqrt{\frac{1}{K+1}}(X + jY)$$

where $K$ is the Rician K-factor (ratio of direct to scattered power), and $X, Y$ are independent Gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance 0.5.

This follows standard wireless communication channel models as described in:

**Rappaport, T.S. (2002).** "Wireless Communications: Principles and Practice." *Prentice Hall*, 2nd edition.

### Pointing Error

The pointing error loss is modeled as:

$$L_{\text{pointing}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\theta^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$

where $\theta$ is the pointing error angle and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the pointing error.

This follows the model in:

**Farid, A.A., and Hranilovic, S. (2007).** "Outage capacity optimization for free-space optical links with pointing errors." *Journal of Lightwave Technology*, 25(7), 1702-1710.

Detailed validation results can be found in the `tests/physics/validation_plots` directory, which contains comparison plots between our implementation and the reference data from these papers.

## Numerical Implementation

Our numerical implementation uses the following techniques to ensure accuracy and efficiency:

1. Vectorized operations for beam profile calculations
2. Proper normalization of LG beams to ensure unit power
3. Accurate calculation of generalized Laguerre polynomials using `scipy.special.genlaguerre`
4. Robust factorial calculation for large indices using `math.lgamma`
5. Efficient turbulence screen generation using von Karman spectrum

These techniques ensure that our simulation is both scientifically accurate and computationally efficient.
