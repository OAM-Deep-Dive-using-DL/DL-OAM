**Deep Q-Learning for Intelligent OAM Mode Handover in 6G Wireless Networks**

This paper presents the first comprehensive implementation of Deep Q-Network (DQN) for intelligent Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) mode handover decisions in 6G wireless networks. We address the critical challenge of optimizing handover strategies that balance throughput maximization against handover overhead in dynamic OAM-based communication systems. Our approach utilizes a physics-based channel simulator incorporating atmospheric turbulence, mode crosstalk, and pointing errors to train a DQN agent over 1000 episodes. The proposed method achieves remarkable generalization performance, with evaluation results showing 133% improvement in throughput and 22.5% reduction in handovers compared to training performance. The agent demonstrates excellent convergence characteristics, with a final reward of +841.31 in evaluation scenarios, indicating robust policy learning and strong generalization capabilities. Our results establish the first 1000-episode OAM handover DQN implementation, providing a solid foundation for intelligent 6G network management.
